* The program is built as two-player tic-tac-toe game, which can be played in the command-line.

* Initially, there would be an empty game board and then we'll have to take inputs from the players 

* Then, we’ll have to check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, we’ll declare the result as “Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game.

* The board is numbered like the keyboard’s number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.

* One can then do the normal bank transactions: deposit, withdraw, check balance or even close and delete their entire bank profile.
